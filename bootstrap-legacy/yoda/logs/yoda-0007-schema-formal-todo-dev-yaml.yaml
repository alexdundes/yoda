    title: Schema formal do `TODO.<dev>.yaml`

    description: Define a validatable schema for `TODO.<dev>.yaml`, including field
    types, required keys, enums, and constraints. The schema must be explicit enough
    to support future validation tooling. This removes ambiguity for agents and scripts.
