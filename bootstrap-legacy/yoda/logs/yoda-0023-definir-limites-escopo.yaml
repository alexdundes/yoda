    title: Definir limites de escopo (out-of-scope)

    description: Define explicit scope boundaries for what the YODA Framework does
    not cover. This should document out-of-scope areas such as CI/CD, architecture
    standards, or HR workflows. The goal is to remove ambiguity about responsibilities.
