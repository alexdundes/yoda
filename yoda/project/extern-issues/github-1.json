  "description": "# Test Issue for External Intake Validation\n\n## Summary\nThis is a fake issue created to validate the `get_extern_issue.py` workflow end to end.\n\n## Context\nWe need a predictable external issue to test how YODA Intake consumes external data and stores it locally in `yoda/project/extern-issues/`.\n\n## Objective\nConfirm that `get_extern_issue.py` can fetch this issue metadata/body and generate a valid local JSON artifact for agent-guided intake.\n\n## Scope\n- Provide a stable external issue payload for testing.\n- Validate provider detection from `origin`.\n- Validate issue fetch by external ID (`#1`).\n- Validate JSON output creation and naming convention.\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Real feature implementation.\n- Production planning.\n- Cross-team delivery commitments.\n- External issue auto-closing behavior.\n\n## Requirements\n- `get_extern_issue.py --dev <slug> --extern-issue 1` must run successfully.\n- Output file must be created at:\n  - `yoda/project/extern-issues/github-1.json` (for GitHub origin)\n  - or `yoda/project/extern-issues/gitlab-1.json` (for GitLab origin)\n- The output must include key fields (provider, origin, external id, title, state, URL, body).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Script fetches issue `#1` without parsing errors.\n- [ ] JSON file is created in the expected folder with the expected filename.\n- [ ] JSON content is valid and readable by `yoda_intake.py --extern-issue 1`.\n- [ ] Intake runbook references the generated JSON file path.\n- [ ] No external issue is closed automatically.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Authenticated CLI for the detected provider (`gh` or `glab`).\n- Accessible repository remote (`origin`) configured.\n\n## Risks and Edge Cases\n- Missing CLI binary.\n- Missing/expired auth token.\n- Wrong repository `origin`.\n- API/network restrictions in sandboxed environments.\n\n## Test Notes\nThis issue is intentionally fake and exists only for workflow verification of external-issue intake.\n",
