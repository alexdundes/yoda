    title: Implement yoda-install.sh one-liner installer

    description: Create the yoda-install.sh script to support the one-liner install
    flow. The script downloads the tarball, verifies sha256 via latest.json, extracts,
    copies the yoda/ subtree per spec, and runs init. Include security warnings and
    support --version/--root/--source.
