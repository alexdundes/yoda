    title: Definir entregaveis minimos por fase do YODA Flow

    description: Define the minimum required deliverables for each YODA Flow phase
    (Study, Document, Implement, Evaluate). The decision should specify what artifacts
    are mandatory so agents and users have consistent expectations. This removes ambiguity
    about what "done" means per phase.
