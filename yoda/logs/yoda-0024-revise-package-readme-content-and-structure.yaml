    title: Revise package README content and structure

    description: Define the full content and structure for the package README.md (English,
    friendly). Include logo block, short tagline, cycles + agent skin concept, inspirations
    (DocDD, Docs-as-Code, Design-first/Contract-first, Literate Programming parallel),
    quick one-liner install with warnings, manual install, init, contents, version/integrity,
    upgrade/rollback, source-of-truth link to upstream specs (TODO placeholder), and
    license note. Add TODO comments for unresolved URLs/hosting. Require updates to
    specs/playbook/yoda/yoda.md to include the agent-skin-in-cycle concept. This issue
    must be higher priority than yoda-0023; yoda-0023 should depend on this.
