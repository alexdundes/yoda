# Agentic Design Patterns (reference)

## Description

The book Agentic Design Patterns organizes recurring patterns for building agentic systems with LLMs. It serves as a catalog of best practices for planning, tool use, collaboration among agents, and quality control.

## Relevance to YODA

- Helps provide vocabulary for YODA flows.
- Reinforces patterns such as planning, routing, reflection, multi-agent, and human-in-the-loop.
- Serves as a basis to evolve YODA scripts and playbooks.

## Suggested use

- Map patterns to YODA artifacts (issues in Markdown, TODO, scripts).
- Adopt only the patterns that make sense for the project.
