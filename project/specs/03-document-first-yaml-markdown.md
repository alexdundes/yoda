# Document-first, YAML, and Markdown

## Document-first

- Documentation comes before implementation.
- Code is the consequence of what is documented.
- The AI must follow the documentation, not loose conversation.

## YAML

- Used for metadata and structures that scripts must read.
- Example: backlog in TODO.dev.yaml, agent configuration.
- Enables automation and structured queries.

## Markdown

- Used for rich free text.
- Example: issues in Markdown (one file per issue), UI specs, business explanations.
- It is the main reading layer for humans and AI.

## Adopted direction

- YAML as source of truth for metadata.
- Markdown for narrative and details.
- Scripts generate skeletons and keep consistency.
