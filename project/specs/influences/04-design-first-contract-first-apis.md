# Design-First / Contract-First for APIs

## What it is

Define the API contract (OpenAPI, GraphQL SDL, gRPC) before implementation.

## Why it inspires YODA

- Separates interface decisions from technical execution.
- Reduces ambiguity and rework between front and back.
- Lets agents use contracts as precise sources.

## How it appears in YODA

- Contracts can be cited in the issue as mandatory inputs.
- The flow encourages interfaces before code.
