# Documentation-Driven Development (DocDD)

## What it is

An approach where documentation is written before implementation and serves as the contract for expected behavior.

## Why it inspires YODA

- Reinforces documentation as the source of truth.
- Forces clarity of requirements before writing code.
- Aligns humans and agents because the doc is the starting point.

## How it appears in YODA

- The issue in Markdown is created before implementation.
- The AI executes only what is documented.
- Changes in code require updates to documentation.
