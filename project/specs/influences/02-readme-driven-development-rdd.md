# README-Driven Development (RDD)

## What it is

Practice of writing the project README before code, ensuring a clear view of purpose, usage, and limits.

## Why it inspires YODA

- Creates a simple entry point for humans and agents.
- Forces the project to explain its value and flow before implementation.
- Helps onboarding and context standardization.

## How it appears in YODA

- The entry documentation guides the agent with zero context.
- README is used as the initial artifact for quick understanding.
