## Relation to YODA

- [DocDD](influences/01-documentation-driven-development-docdd.md) and [Docs-as-Code](influences/03-docs-as-code.md) support documentation as the source of truth.
- [RDD](influences/02-readme-driven-development-rdd.md) reinforces the README as the entry point.
- [Design-First / Contract-First](influences/04-design-first-contract-first-apis.md) helps with contracts and integrations.
- [ADRs](influences/05-adr-architecture-decision-records.md) record technical decisions.
- [Notebooks](influences/06-literate-programming-notebooks.md) can be used for exploration and prototypes.
- [Agentic Design Patterns](influences/07-agentic-design-patterns.md) provide a vocabulary for planning, routing, reflection, and human-in-the-loop patterns.
