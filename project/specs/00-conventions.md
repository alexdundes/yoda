# Conventions

This file defines normative language and common conventions for the YODA Framework specs.

## Normative keywords

The following keywords are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119:

- MUST: absolute requirement
- SHOULD: strong recommendation
- MAY: optional

## Formats

- Dates and timestamps MUST use ISO 8601.
- Timezone MUST be explicit and use Brasilia time (America/Sao_Paulo) with offset.
- Text files MUST be UTF-8.

## Paths

- All paths MUST be relative to the repository root.

## Source of truth precedence

- For framework definition, project/specs is the source of truth.
- For a task, the issue Markdown file is the source of truth over conversation.
- If templates conflict with specs, specs MUST win.

## Notes

- When in doubt, prefer explicitness over inference.
