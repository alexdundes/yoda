# Out of scope (v1)

## Purpose

Define what the YODA Framework does not cover in v1 to avoid ambiguity.

## Statement

YODA v1 defines a process for agent-assisted implementation work. It does not define organization-wide practices, platform operations, or delivery infrastructure.

## Out-of-scope list

- CI/CD pipelines and release automation.
- Deployment, infrastructure, and environment management.
- Architecture standards and technology selection.
- Security, compliance, and governance programs.
- Product management, roadmap, and marketing.
- HR, hiring, and team management processes.
- Legal, finance, and procurement workflows.

## Future extensions

Tools for distribution and delivery may exist in future versions, but they are not part of the framework scope in v1.
