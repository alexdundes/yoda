# YODA Framework Overview

## Definition

 The YODA Framework is a document-first approach to AI-assisted development. It organizes collaboration between humans and agents using structured documentation and automation, focused on consistency, repeatability, and traceability.

## Acronym

YODA = YAML-Oriented Documentation & Agents

## Core principles

- Documentation as source of truth: the project is described before implementation.
- YAML as the gravity center: metadata and structure live in YAML.
- Markdown as the narrative layer: context, criteria, and details live in free text.
- Agents and scripts execute what is documented.
- Agents can start with zero context by reading the right files.

## Goal

Create an environment where humans and AI follow a shared flow, with clear patterns for artifacts, scripts, and process.
