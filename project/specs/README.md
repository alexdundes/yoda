# YODA Framework - Specs (en)

This README organizes the topics discussed so far. Each topic has a dedicated file in this folder. The **human entrypoint** for a YODA-enabled project is the repo `README.md`; the **agent entrypoint** is `yoda/yoda.md`.

## Language policy

- project/specs is always in English to improve agent interoperability.
- Other repo content may be in Portuguese during development.
- The final YODA Framework will be published in English; Portuguese content is provisional.
