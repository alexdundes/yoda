# TODO.dev.yaml and issues in Markdown

## Objective

Separate the backlog and metadata from the rich issue descriptions.

## Preferred direction

- One TODO per person, in the format TODO.dev.yaml (dev = developer slug).
- Each issue has its own Markdown file in yoda/project/issues/.
- TODO.dev.yaml references the path of each issue Markdown file.
- Issue files contain only free description (context, criteria, notes).
- A script creates the issue and the initial Markdown skeleton.

## Location and naming

- Issues folder: yoda/project/issues/
- File name: dev-id-slug.md
  - dev = developer slug
  - id = sequential, generated by the TODO script
  - slug = slug of the title

## Canonical ID

- Canonical issue id: dev-id (example: alex-001)
- Use the canonical id in depends_on.
- IDs are unique across the repo (not only within a single TODO).
- Optional human alias (example: A-001) is allowed only if a fixed prefix map exists per developer.

## Minimal schema for TODO.dev.yaml

Each issue item must contain:

- id: canonical id (dev-id), generated by the script
- title: issue title
- slug: slug of the title (used in the issue file name)
- description: brief description of what needs to be done
- entrypoints: array of objects with:
  - path: file path (issue or other artifact)
  - type: entrypoint type (issue, code, other in the future)
- status: to-do | doing | do-it | pending
- priority: 0 to 10 (10 = highest priority)
- labels: list of labels
- agent: Human | Codex | Antigravity | ...
- depends_on: list of ids
- pending_reason: reason for pending (when status = pending)
- created_at, updated_at

Note: there is no owner, because each dev has their own TODO.

## Status (definitions)

- to-do: created, not started yet
- doing: started in the YODA Flow for the issue
- do-it: YODA Flow cycle finished
- pending: blocker identified during YODA Flow; record the reason in pending_reason and keep on stand-by until resolved

## Benefits

- Single source of truth for work state.
- Bulk operations are simple (list, filter, reorder).
- Token savings by sending only TODO.dev.yaml for planning.
- Markdown free for high-quality writing.

## Minimal identifier

The issue Markdown file must have a minimal identifier to link to TODO.dev.yaml, for example:

- Use the ID in the Markdown title.

## Notes

- The AI must not edit TODO.dev.yaml directly; it must call scripts.
- The AI can freely edit the issue text.
