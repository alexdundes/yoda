  intent:
    - Preserves artifacts generated during the bootstrap of this meta-implementation.
    - Bootstrap ran without scripts, so YAML artifacts in the spec did not exist.
    - Agents used Markdown alternatives in place of YAML during bootstrap.
    - Later, scripts generated YAML from Markdown records to validate concepts.
    - Not used by the current workflow; kept for historical verification.
